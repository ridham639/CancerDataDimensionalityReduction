Overview:
This repository contains a case study on using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze a cancer dataset. PCA is a statistical 
technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining as much variance as possible. In this project, we explore how PCA 
can be applied to cancer data to uncover patterns and relationships among features that might help in understanding and diagnosing cancer.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this study consists of clinical measurements collected from cancer patients. It includes features such as tumor size,
patient age, histological grade, and other relevant medical parameters. The goal is to apply PCA to this dataset and identify principal 
components that capture the most significant variations among these features.

Methodology:
1.Data Preprocessing: Standardize the dataset to ensure all features have a mean of zero and unit variance. This step is crucial for PCA as
it ensures that each feature contributes equally to the analysis.

2.Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Compute the covariance matrix of the standardized data and derive its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. 
Sort the eigenvalues in descending order to identify principal components that explain the maximum variance in the data.

3.Interpretation: Analyze the principal components to understand which features contribute most to the variability in the dataset.
Visualize the results to gain insights into the underlying structure of the cancer data.
